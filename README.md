### Brief

*   Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

*   [Easybank landing page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN)

*   You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

*   The only JavaScript required is for the mobile navigation toggle. However, you could also try doing this without JS.

*   Your users should be able to:

    *   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
    *   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

*   Download the starter code and go through the Project.md file.
*   This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
